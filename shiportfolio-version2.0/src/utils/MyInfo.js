👋 Hello! I'm Shi — a full-stack developer who codes with curiosity and lives on coffee. My portfolio is a little window into my tech journey, the things I build, and the fun I have while learning and experimenting.

💡 About Me:
I'm passionate about coding, design, and self-growth. I love turning ideas into functional, user-friendly experiences. Whether it's building a web app, debugging until 2 AM, or learning a new framework just for fun — I'm always looking for the next challenge.

🔧 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MySQL, MongoDB
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Figma

🎯 What I Do:
- Web-development
- full-stack web-development

🧠 Mindset:
I believe learning never stops. I love experimenting with new ideas and tech stacks — and even when I fail, I see it as a step forward. My coding journey is a mix of fun, trial and error, and a lot of late-night debugging.

🎉 Just for Fun:
- ☕ I need at least 2 cups of coffee to start debugging.
- 📱 I scroll through about 15 TikToks a day (purely for “research,” of course).
- ⌨️ I once fixed a bug by simply... restarting my laptop (tech magic!).
- 🎮 Favorite break: retro-style games or coding-themed memes.
- 🎧 Coding vibe: lo-fi beats, thunderstorm sounds, and a hint of caffeine.
- 🐛 Favorite quote: "99 bugs in the code, take one down, patch it around… 127 bugs in the code."
